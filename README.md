# Black Reads

Link to Back End Repository: [Black Reads Back End](https://github.com/crutell331/black-reads-backend "Back End Repository")


## Motivation and Objective

As a person of color I find it difficult to discover great literature by black authors who aren't already well known. So, the concept behind this project is to build an app that will introduce users to black authors of varying levels of notoriety 


## Features

- User Authenticaion using JWT and LocalStorage
- React/Redux + Ruby on Rails
- CSS using Bootstrap and Flexbox (separate branches)
- User can view featured books and authors by category as well as search a books and authors index


## In Progress

- Integrating Goodreads API to expand books library
- Implement book reviews
- Impliment "book club" feature that allows users to join book clubs and organize discussions together
